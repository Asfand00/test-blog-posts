## To run app

1. Use `npm install` and then `npm start` to run app in terminal after cloning repo

### Current minor issues with app 

1. when creating a post, using filter will erase new posts
2. when trying to edit post can only edit title portion but nothing will change when clicking save
3. trying to edit any other part of post will make the post stuck in edit mode because save will not work

If encountering any minor issues simply reloading the app will fix it by typing `r` in terminal
